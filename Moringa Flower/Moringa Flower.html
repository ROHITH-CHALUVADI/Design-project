            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Moringa flower, despite its remarkable nutritional value and culinary potential, has somewhat fallen into obscurity in South India. Several factors contribute to this. One primary reason is the gradual shift towards modern agricultural practices and the emphasis on cash crops, which has led to a decline in traditional farming of diverse crops like moringa. Additionally, changing dietary habits and a growing preference for convenience foods may have diminished the demand for locally sourced, seasonal produce such as moringa flowers. Furthermore, urbanization and globalization have introduced a plethora of food options, often overshadowing indigenous ingredients like moringa flowers. Lack of awareness about the health benefits and culinary uses of moringa flowers could also contribute to their neglect. Efforts to revive interest in traditional foods and promote the nutritional value of moringa flowers could help reintroduce this forgotten ingredient into South Indian cuisines.</p>

                <h3>Cooking Procedure</h3>
                <div id="co">
                    <div id="instr">
                    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Prepare the moringa flowers: Start by plucking the fresh moringa flowers from the stem and removing any tough stems or sepals attached to the flowers. Rinse the flowers thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Drain well and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Heat oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and allow them to splutter for a few seconds.</li>
                            <li>Add minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until fragrant and lightly golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Add finely chopped onions to the skillet and cook until they turn translucent and start to brown around the edges.</li>
                            <li>If using, add chopped green chili to the skillet for a spicy kick. Sauté for another minute.</li>
                            <li>Add the cleaned moringa flowers to the skillet. Stir well to coat the flowers with the oil and onion mixture.</li>
                            <li>Season the moringa flowers with salt and turmeric powder. Mix everything together until the flowers are evenly coated with the spices.</li>
                            <li>Cover the skillet with a lid and let the moringa flowers cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. The flowers should be tender but still retain their vibrant green color.</li>
                            <li>Once the moringa flowers are cooked, remove the skillet from heat. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the cooked flowers for a burst of citrus flavor (optional).</li>
                            <li>Garnish the cooked moringa flowers with fresh coriander leaves for added freshness and aroma.</li>
                            <li>Serve the cooked moringa flowers hot as a side dish with rice or flatbread. Enjoy the nutritious and delicious flavors of this unique dish!</li>
