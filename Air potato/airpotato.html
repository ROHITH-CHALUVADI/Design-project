            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>    Air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera), also known as "Varikka" or "Kaachil" in some regions of South India, was once a part of traditional diets and indigenous medicinal practices. However, its status as a forgotten vegetable in South India can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the vine-like nature of the air potato plant makes it invasive and challenging to cultivate in controlled agricultural settings. As a result, it is often perceived as a weed rather than a valuable food crop. Additionally, the tubers of the air potato contain toxins, particularly dioscorine, which can be harmful if not processed and cooked properly. This toxicity, combined with the rise of modern agriculture and the availability of safer alternatives, has led to a decline in the consumption and cultivation of air potato in South India. Consequently, it has gradually faded from the culinary landscape, becoming one of the forgotten vegetables of the region.</p>
