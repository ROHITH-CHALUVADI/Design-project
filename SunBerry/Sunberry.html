            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Sun berry, also known as Solanum nigrum or black nightshade, has gradually faded into obscurity in South India primarily due to several factors. Firstly, there is a misconception surrounding its toxicity, as certain varieties of black nightshade contain poisonous compounds, leading to apprehension among consumers about its safety for consumption. Additionally, the plant's prolific growth in diverse habitats often categorizes it as a weed, further contributing to its disregard as a cultivated vegetable. Changes in dietary preferences and the availability of commercial produce have also played a role, with modern consumers favoring more familiar and commercially prominent vegetables. Consequently, the sun berry, once valued for its medicinal properties and culinary versatility in traditional South Indian cuisine, has slipped from the collective memory, overshadowed by other more widely cultivated and perceived safer options.</p>

                            <li>
                            <b>Preparation: </b>
                            Start by harvesting fresh sunberries from the plant. Ensure they are ripe, plump, and free from any signs of damage or spoilage. Rinse the sunberries thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Drain well and set aside.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Heat Oil: </b>
                            Heat the cooking oil in a skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and allow them to splutter for a few seconds.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Sauté Aromatics:  </b>
                            Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until fragrant and lightly golden brown. Then, add the finely chopped onion to the skillet and cook until translucent and slightly caramelized.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Add Spice (Optional):  </b>
                            If you prefer a spicy dish, you can add a chopped green chili to the skillet at this stage. Sauté for another minute to release its flavors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Incorporate Sunberries:  </b>
                            Add the cleaned sunberries to the skillet. Stir well to coat the sunberries with the oil and onion mixture.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <b>Cook: </b>
                            Cover the skillet with a lid and let the sunberries cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sunberries should become tender but still retain their shape and texture.

                            <li>

                            Once the sunberries are cooked, you can squeeze some fresh lemon juice over them for a burst of citrus flavor. This step is optional but adds brightness to the dish.
                            </li>
