            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Turkey berry, known locally as "Sundakkai" in South India, has gradually become a forgotten vegetable due to several factors. Firstly, changes in dietary preferences and lifestyles have led to a decline in the consumption of traditional and indigenous vegetables like turkey berry. As people embrace more modern and convenience-oriented diets, they often overlook or replace lesser-known vegetables with more widely available options. Additionally, the commercialization of agriculture has resulted in a focus on high-yield crops, sidelining lesser-known varieties like turkey berry. Farmers may prioritize cultivating cash crops with higher market demand, leading to a decline in the cultivation of indigenous vegetables. Furthermore, urbanization and globalization have contributed to the disappearance of traditional vegetables from local markets, as supermarkets tend to stock a limited range of popular and commercially viable produce. Consequently, despite its nutritional value and culinary versatility, turkey berry has sadly slipped into obscurity in South India.</p>

                            <li>
                            <b>Preparation: </b>
                            Rinse the turkey berries thoroughly under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, pat them dry using a kitchen towel or paper towel. Once dried, cut off the stem ends of the turkey berries and make a small slit lengthwise on each berry. This helps to ensure that the flavors penetrate the berries during cooking.

                            <li>
                            <b>Tempering: </b>
                            Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and allow them to splutter. Then, add the urad dal and chana dal, and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Adding Aromatics: </b>
                            Add the dried red chilies and curry leaves to the skillet, and sauté for a few seconds until fragrant. If using garlic, you can add it at this stage and sauté until it turns golden brown. You can also add finely chopped onions at this point if desired and sauté until they turn translucent.

                            <b>Cooking Turkey Berries: </b>
                            Add the prepared turkey berries to the skillet and stir well to coat them with the tempered spices. Allow the turkey berries to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they are tender but still slightly crisp. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Seasoning: </b>
                            Once the turkey berries are cooked to your desired consistency, season them with salt according to taste. Stir well to incorporate the salt evenly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Finishing Touches: </b>
                            At this stage, you can add any additional seasonings or garnishes of your choice, such as freshly grated coconut or chopped coriander leaves. Give the dish a final stir to combine all the flavors.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <b>Serving: </b>
                            Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the cooked turkey berry poriyal to a serving dish. Serve hot as a side dish alongside steamed rice and other South Indian curries or as an accompaniment to Indian breads like chapati or dosa.
