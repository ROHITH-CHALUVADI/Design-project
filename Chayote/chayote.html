            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Chayote, commonly known as Chow-Chow, has gradually slipped into obscurity in South India, primarily due to shifting cultural preferences, changing agricultural practices, and the availability of alternative vegetables. As South Indian society modernizes, there has been a noticeable trend towards adopting more Westernized diets, leading to a decreased demand for traditional vegetables like chayote. Moreover, with agricultural production increasingly focusing on high-yield crops favored for their commercial profitability, farmers may prioritize cultivating crops with broader market appeal, relegating indigenous vegetables like chayote to the sidelines. Additionally, the globalization of food markets has introduced South Indians to a wider array of vegetables from around the world, diminishing the prominence of native varieties like chayote. Furthermore, lacking effective promotion or positive marketing efforts, traditional vegetables such as chayote may struggle to compete with more popular or trendy options in the eyes of consumers. Consequently, despite its historical significance in South Indian cuisine, chayote is now often overlooked and considered forgotten in the region.</p>

                            <ul>
                            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. </li>
                            <li>Add the mustard seeds to the hot oil and let them splutter.
                            <li>Add the cumin seeds and curry leaves to the pan, followed by the minced garlic and green chili. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant. </li>
                            <li>Add the thinly sliced onions to the pan and cook until they turn translucent and slightly golden brown. </li>
                            <li>Add the sliced chayote to the pan and stir well to combine with the onion mixture. </li>
                            <li>Season the chayote with turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt to taste. Stir to coat the chayote evenly with the spices. </li>

                            <li>Once the chayote is cooked, remove the lid and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow any excess moisture to evaporate and to enhance the flavors. </li>
