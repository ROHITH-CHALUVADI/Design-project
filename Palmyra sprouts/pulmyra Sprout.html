            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Palmyra sprout, traditionally known as 'Panang Kizhangu' in South India, has gradually faded into obscurity for several reasons. One significant factor contributing to its decline is the changing landscape of agricultural practices and dietary preferences. As modern farming techniques prioritize high-yield crops with shorter growth cycles, traditional and less commercially viable crops like the Palmyra palm have been marginalized. Additionally, urbanization and the influence of globalized food cultures have shifted consumer preferences towards convenience foods and exotic imports, further diminishing the demand for indigenous vegetables like the Palmyra sprout. Furthermore, the labor-intensive process of harvesting and processing the Palmyra sprouts, which involves extracting the tender shoots from the tall and thorny Palmyra palm trees, has contributed to its decline as labor availability diminishes and mechanization becomes more prevalent. Consequently, despite its historical significance and nutritional value, the Palmyra sprout has become a forgotten vegetable in South India, overshadowed by more commercially viable and easily accessible alternatives.</p>

                <h3>Cooking Procedure</h3>
                <div id="co">
                    <div id="instr">
                    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Begin by preparing the Palmyra sprouts. Rinse them thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. Trim off the tough ends and any discolored parts. Then, cut the sprouts into bite-sized pieces and set aside.</li>
                            <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan or kadhai over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Allow them to splutter for a few seconds.</li>
                            <li>If using, add the dried red chilies to the pan and sauté for a few seconds until they become fragrant.</li>
                            <li>Add the finely chopped onion to the pan and sauté until it turns translucent and starts to brown slightly.</li>
                            <li>Stir in the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for another minute until the raw aroma of garlic disappears and the ingredients are well combined.</li>
                            <li>Now, add a pinch of asafoetida (hing) and turmeric powder to the pan. Mix well to evenly coat the spices with the other ingredients.</li>
                            <li>Carefully add the prepared Palmyra sprouts to the pan. Stir to combine the sprouts with the spice mixture.</li>
                            <li>Season with salt according to taste and continue to cook the sprouts for about 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are tender but still retain a slight crunch.</li>
