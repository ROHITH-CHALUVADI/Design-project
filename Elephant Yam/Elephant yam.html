            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Elephant yam, a staple in traditional South Indian cuisine, has gradually become forgotten due to several factors. One reason is the changing dietary preferences influenced by urbanization and globalization. As South Indian society becomes more urbanized, there has been a shift towards convenience foods and imported vegetables, relegating indigenous varieties like elephant yam to the sidelines. Additionally, the labor-intensive preparation required to process elephant yam, including peeling and boiling to remove toxins, may deter modern consumers accustomed to faster cooking methods. Furthermore, the limited availability of elephant yam in supermarkets and the decline of traditional markets where it was once commonly found have contributed to its gradual disappearance from everyday meals. Despite its nutritional value and culinary versatility, the elephant yam's decline reflects broader trends in the agricultural and culinary landscapes of South India.</p>
